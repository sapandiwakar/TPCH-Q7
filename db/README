-- creates database
$> mysql -u username -p < create_database.sql

1- creates database
2- creates tables
3- loads tables
4- makes constraints (this is done after data is loaded to speed up loading)
5- renames tables to use q7 as it is

I am not sure whether dbgen always generates the same db but q7_output.txt 
is the output of s=0.1, n1.name=GERMANY and n2.name=FRANCE
